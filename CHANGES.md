# Quote Server Changes Summary

The project was an very simple spring boot example for read one entry or a list of quotes, based on jdk 17 and spring boot 2.5.4
As experiment cursor.ai was used to update the jdk version, add tests (only one existed) improve code and generate comments/documentation.
After some iterations with failing tests or compile errors it worked flawless.

This are the detailed changes (Also summerized by the ai)

## 1. Project Structure Updates
- Updated Spring Boot version from 2.5.4 to 3.2.3 for Java 21 compatibility
  - Resolved ASM ClassReader error that was preventing application startup
  - Updated to use Jakarta EE 9+ annotations and dependencies
- Added validation dependency for Jakarta EE
  - Added `jakarta.validation-api` for input validation
  - Implemented `@NotBlank` and `@Size` constraints
- Changed H2 database scope from runtime to test
  - Moved H2 database to test scope for integration testing
  - Configured H2 for in-memory testing with proper schema initialization

## 2. Entity Layer (Quote.java)
- Changed JPA imports from `javax.persistence` to `jakarta.persistence`
  - Updated all JPA annotations to use Jakarta EE 9+ namespace
  - Ensured compatibility with Spring Boot 3.x

    - Case-insensitive partial match search
    - Returns list of quotes with matching authors
  - `findByQuoteContainingIgnoreCase(String quote)`
    - Case-insensitive partial match search
    - Returns list of quotes with matching text
- Added comprehensive Javadoc comments
  - Interface-level documentation
  - Method-level documentation with parameter and return descriptions
  - Usage examples in comments

## 4. Test Layer
- Created test configuration (`TestConfig.java`)
  - Configured H2 in-memory database
  - Set up proper JPA test environment
- Added test properties (`application-test.properties`)
